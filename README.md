# Disease Detection using Artificial Intelligence 

## About the Project
#### The objective of this project is to create a Web based application to detect diseases based on some common parameters. The diseases focused in the project are Lung Cancer, Breast Cancer, Heart Disease and Diabetes. Machine Learning algorithms are used to train the four models for the detection of the mentioned diseases. A website is created using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to deploy these models. The website works by taking the input parameters of the respective diseases using a form and gives an output in the form of a message specifying whether the user has or does not have the disease. 

## About the Dataset
###The datasets for all the four disease were taken from Kaggle.
